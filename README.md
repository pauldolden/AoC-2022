### AoC 2022

I decided to use AoC this year as a means of learning Go.

Alot of this code, particularly in the early challenges is the "quick and dirty" approach to solving these problems.

I'm hoping that over the course of the challenges my competency improves and my grasp of Go gets better.

I'm keeping this here for posterity and my own reference.
